  Starter for a Gatsby Plugin
</h1>

A minimal boilerplate for the essential files Gatsby looks for in a plugin.

## 🚀 Quick start

To get started creating a new plugin, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a new plugin from the starter with `gatsby new`

```shell
gatsby new my-plugin https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-plugin
```

If you already have a Gatsby site, you can use it. Otherwise, you can [create a new Gatsby site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#create-a-gatsby-site) to test your plugin.

Your directory structure will look similar to this:

```text
/my-gatsby-site
├── gatsby-config.js
└── /src
    └── /pages
        └── /index.js
/my-plugin
├── gatsby-browser.js
├── gatsby-node.js
├── gatsby-ssr.js
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

With `my-gatsby-site` being your Gatsby site, and `my-plugin` being your plugin. You could also include the plugin in your [site's `plugins` folder](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/loading-plugins-from-your-local-plugins-folder/).

2. Include the plugin in a Gatsby site

Inside of the `gatsby-config.js` file of your site (in this case, `my-gatsby-site`), include the plugin in the `plugins` array:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // other gatsby plugins
    // ...
    require.resolve(`../my-plugin`),
  ],
}
```

The line `require.resolve('../my-plugin')` is what accesses the plugin based on its filepath on your computer, and adds it as a plugin when Gatsby runs.

_You can use this method to test and develop your plugin before you publish it to a package registry like npm. Once published, you would instead install it and [add the plugin name to the array](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-a-plugin-in-your-site/). You can read about other ways to connect your plugin to your site including using `npm link` or `yarn workspaces` in the [doc on creating local plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/creating-a-local-plugin/#developing-a-local-plugin-that-is-outside-your-project)._

3. Verify the plugin was added correctly

The plugin added by the starter implements a single Gatsby API in the `gatsby-node` that logs a message to the console. When you run `gatsby develop` or `gatsby build` in the site that implements your plugin, you should see this message.

You can verify your plugin was added to your site correctly by running `gatsby develop` for the site.

You should now see a message logged to the console in the preinit phase of the Gatsby build process:

```shell
$ gatsby develop
success open and validate gatsby-configs - 0.033s
success load plugins - 0.074s
Loaded gatsby-starter-plugin
success onPreInit - 0.016s
...
```

4. Rename the plugin in the `package.json`

When you clone the site, the information in the `package.json` will need to be updated. Name your plugin based off of [Gatsby's conventions for naming plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/naming-a-plugin/).

## 🧐 What's inside?

This starter generates the [files Gatsby looks for in plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/files-gatsby-looks-for-in-a-plugin/).

```text
/my-plugin
├── .gitignore
├── gatsby-browser.js
├── gatsby-node.js
├── gatsby-ssr.js
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

- **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.
- **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.
- **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.
- **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.
- **`index.js`**: A file that will be loaded by default when the plugin is [required by another application](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-node-js-modules#create-the-file-that-will-be-loaded-when-your-module-is-required-by-another-application0). You can adjust what file is used by updating the `main` field of the `package.json`.
- **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the plugin's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
- **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your plugin.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

If you're looking for more guidance on plugins, how they work, or what their role is in the Gatsby ecosystem, check out some of these resources:

- The [Creating Plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/creating-plugins/) section of the docs has information on authoring and maintaining plugins yourself.
- The conceptual guide on [Plugins, Themes, and Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins-themes-and-starters/) compares and contrasts plugins with other pieces of the Gatsby ecosystem. It can also help you [decide what to choose between a plugin, starter, or theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins-themes-and-starters/#deciding-which-to-use).
- The [Gatsby plugin library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) has over 1750 official as well as community developed plugins that can get you up and running faster and borrow ideas from.
